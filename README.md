# Pre-work - *Tiptastic*

**Tiptastic** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Jacquelyn Chow**

Time spent: **8+** hours spent in total ((Will work on it after submission too))

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values using the slider and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:
- [X] App logo and image
- [X] Split bill and tip total amongst 1-3 people
Currently working on:
- [ ] Light Mode/Dark Mode
- [ ] Maximum tip value for slider
